# Stock Market Pattern Detection using SAX

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates how to use Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX) to identify specific patterns in stock market index data. It includes a simulated API call to fetch historical stock prices, applies SAX to transform the numerical data into symbolic strings, and then searches for predefined symbolic patterns.

## üìä Project Overview

The core idea is to simplify complex, high-dimensional time series data (like stock prices) into a more manageable, lower-dimensional symbolic representation. This allows for efficient pattern recognition, especially useful in scenarios involving large datasets or streaming data where traditional numerical analysis can be computationally expensive.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Simulated API Data Fetching:** Includes a function `fetch_stock_data` that simulates fetching daily closing prices for a given stock symbol from a hypothetical API. This function is designed to be easily adaptable to real stock data APIs (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Finnhub).
* **Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX):** Utilizes the `pyts` library to convert numerical stock price data into a sequence of symbols. This process involves:
    * **Piecewise Aggregate Approximation (PAA):** Reducing the dimensionality of the time series by averaging segments.
    * **Symbolic Conversion:** Mapping the aggregated values to discrete symbols (e.g., 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd') based on a Gaussian distribution strategy.
* **Pattern Definition and Search:** Allows for defining specific "trend" patterns (e.g., a "bullish trend" like 'ccd') in symbolic form and efficiently searching for these patterns within the SAX-transformed stock data.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* `pandas`
* `numpy`
* `pyts`
* `requests` (for actual API calls, though simulated in this example)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy pyts requests

### Usage

1.  **Clone the repository (or copy the code):**
    ```bash
    git clone [your-repo-name]
    cd [your-repo-name]
    ```
    *(Note: If you're running this directly in a Canvas environment, you can just use the provided code.)*

2.  **Obtain an API Key (for real data):**
    * If you wish to use real stock data, you'll need an API key from a stock data provider. Popular choices include:
        * [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/) (offers a free tier)
        * [Finnhub](https://finnhub.io/)
        * [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com/)
    * Once you have an API key, **replace `"YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE"`** in the `API_KEY` variable within the Python script (`main.py` or similar).
    * **Uncomment the `requests.get(API_URL)` block** and update `API_URL` to the actual endpoint for your chosen service.

3.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python your_script_name.py
    ```
    (Replace `your_script_name.py` with the actual name of your Python file).

### Customization

* **`STOCK_SYMBOL`**: Change `"SPY"` to any other stock ticker (e.g., `"AAPL"`, `"GOOGL"`) to analyze different assets.
* **`window_size`**: Adjust the size of the sliding window (e.g., `12` days for a fortnight, `20` for a month of trading days) to define the length of the segments you want to analyze.
* **`n_segments`**: Modify how many sub-segments each `window_size` period is broken into for PAA. This affects the length of your SAX symbol string.
* **`n_bins`**: Change the number of symbols in your alphabet (e.g., `4` for 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'; `5` for 'a' through 'e'). A higher number of bins provides more granularity but less compression.
* **`target_pattern`**: Define your own symbolic patterns to search for. Experiment with different sequences of 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' (or more if you increase `n_bins`) to represent various market trends (e.g., 'abd' for a dip and recovery, 'aaa' for a stable period).
